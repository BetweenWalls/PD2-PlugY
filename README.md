## Setup Guide
1. Pre-Setup - Ensure you have *Diablo II LoD* and *PD2* installed
3. Add PlugY - copy the *ProjectD2* folder included here into your *Diablo II* folder
3. Run PlugY.exe as administrator

You'll still need to run PD2 via the launcher occasionally to get the latest patch/update.

If you want to update old character/stash files, see [PD2-Converter](https://github.com/BetweenWalls/PD2-Converter#simple-characterstash-converter-for-pd2).

There are in-game commands for renaming stash pages and moving stash pages around, as well as some other useful commands such as renaming characters - checkout the PlugY Readme file.

## Bugs
See the wiki for a full list of [bugs](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Bugs#Singleplayer-Only_Bugs). Singleplayer-specific bugs include:
* Having too many items in a stash page with many affixes (e.g. maps) can cause a crash if that page is the most recently visited stash page
* Having gold in the shared stash can cause issues, preventing oskills and other stats from working correctly
* Andariel quest bug
