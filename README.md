## Bugs
See the wiki for a full list of [bugs](https://wiki.projectdiablo2.com/wiki/Bugs#Singleplayer-Only_Bugs). Singleplayer-specific bugs include:
* Having too many items in a stash page with many affixes (e.g. maps) can cause a crash if that page is the most recently visited stash page
* Having gold in the shared stash can cause issues, preventing oskills and other stats from working correctly
* Andariel quest bug
